# winTerm_themes
A few themes I've made for the Windows Terminal App, to paste into the JSON file.

##Note
I don't really use these that often anymore. I use Linux as my primary operating system now.

To add them, open settings, open the JSON file, navigate to schemes, and paste this in. Make sure to add commas when necessary.

Themes:
* Guacamole
  * A green theme that goes well with the Node.js REPL.

* Monochrome Retro
  * A monochromatic theme inspired by old IBM PCs and such. I use it for the Windows Command Prompt

* Ubuntu Term
    * A theme with a purple background, designed to resemble the terminal theme in Ubuntu. Great for use with, of course, Ubuntu WSL.
